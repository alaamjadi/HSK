    1. Try to use DATETIME, check this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_dates.asp) -->postgreSQL does not have it

    2. Increase the photo_addres size --> done!
    3. service/staff they should be all connected, so each of them should have two foreign keys. --> no!! it is not like this, no need to have it!
    4. Revise Involve/Has, present tables --> done!
    5. Event-Staff table missing --> no need to have!
