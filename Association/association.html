        <p class="fontt">In 1997 he became
          aware at the European Institute of Oncology that
          Patients in the most advanced stages of their
          disease are often dismissed by the Doctor with these
          words: " <strong>There is
            nothing more to do, we have done everything
            possible.
          </strong>Instead when the
          disease is no longer curable or controllable with
          specific active treatments, it is <strong>still
            possible to cure the symfonttoms (pain, nausea,
            vomiting, depression, ...).</strong></p>

          with his family, not feel abandoned by the National
          Health System.Especially in the
          final phase of life, the patient <strong>should be
            assisted in his home</strong>or, when not
          possible, in a <strong>dedicated
            hospitalization facility</strong>Hospice that can
          guarantee palliative care (clinical, psychological,
          spiritual) for him and his family.</p>

          the Division of General Surgery at the European
          Institute of Oncology, received a conspicuous legacy
          that allowed him to<strong> realize a
            dream</strong>: to build a
          residential structure where he could welcome and
          accompany patients with advanced, incurable,
          terminal illnesses and People with serious
          psycho-physical-social frailties, with a Palliative
          Medicine Research Center and Training for doctors,
          nurses, psychologists, social workers and family

            came into being</strong> with the aim of

          identifies an<strong> old</strong> 14th century <strong>Lombard
